# AI Ops Labs (In Progress)

This directory is for experiments in AI-assisted operations design.

Planned content:

- Multi-agent reasoning patterns based on ChaosOS™
- Prompt / agent design for specific ops problems
- Automation prototypes (escalation flows, decision trees, safety guardrails)
- Notes on what works, what breaks, and how I iterate

The goal is to show how I use GPT-style systems as an **operations layer**:
supporting real decisions, not just generating text.
