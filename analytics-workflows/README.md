# Analytics Workflows (In Progress)

This directory will hold applied analytics workflows that connect business questions to data, logic, and decisions.

Planned content:

- KPI definitions and metric trees
- “business question → data model → SQL/query → insight” examples
- Operations dashboards and monitoring logic
- Documentation for how I’d brief stakeholders on findings

These workflows are designed to show how I think like a Data / BI / AI Ops practitioner:
not just writing queries, but turning real-world chaos into structured, decision-ready insight.
