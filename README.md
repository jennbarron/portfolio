## 🧩 ChaosOS™ Architecture  
*A real, working multi-agent GPT operating system.*

![ChaosOS Architecture](chaosOS/assets/chaosOS-architecture.png)

ChaosOS™ is a **role-based, multi-agent framework** I engineered inside GPT to manage high-complexity workflows across multiple real-world domains.

It powers decisions for:

- medical + health escalation  
- legal disputes & compliance  
- government systems  
- finance + risk workflows  
- travel safety & logistics  
- homeschooling & education  
- job search optimization  
- safety interventions  
- multi-step planning and analytics  

ChaosOS is:  
**(1)** a real operational system I use every day, and  
**(2)** a portfolio artifact showcasing how I design and maintain complex Data + AI workflows.

## 👋 About Me

I bring **15+ years in Customer Experience & Operations** — remote leadership, high-volume workflows, escalations, and system rescue.

Now I’m transitioning into **Data + AI-powered Operations**, where I combine:

- structured analytical reasoning  
- SQL + data analysis  
- workflow modeling  
- AI system design  
- cross-domain problem solving  

ChaosOS is my proof-of-concept for that transition.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Data + AI-powered **operations design**  
- SQL fundamentals & analytical querying  
- Business → data translation  
- Multi-agent GPT system design (ChaosOS™, KidOS™)  
- Git & GitHub for versioned, auditable work

## 🧠 ChaosOS™ — System Overview

ChaosOS uses a **hub + spoke architecture**, similar to how modern data systems manage complexity.

### **Core Components**

**BRG — Bridge Layer**  
Routes context safely between specialized agents.

**SCX — Shared Context Layer**  
Stores permanent truths, constraints, and long-term facts.

**LifeVaultDB — Evidence + Memory Layer**  
Documents, timelines, records, and cross-domain history.

---

### **Spokes (Agents)**  
33+ independent reasoning modules, including:

- HEA / FHEA — Medical Reasoning  
- LEG — Legal Strategy  
- PER — Emotional Safety  
- MON / FIN — Money + Risk  
- TRV — Travel & Logistics  
- JOB — Career Navigation  
- COA — Admin + Coordination  
- KID / SCH — Family + Schooling  
- DEC — Decision Engine  
- REL — Relocation  
- …and many more  

Each agent handles its own domain.  
BRG prevents cross-contamination.  
DEC consolidates logic.  
SCX maintains truth stability.

This is effectively **a real AI operating system built out of reasoning modules.**
