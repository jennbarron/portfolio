# Jennifer Barron — Data + AI Ops Portfolio  
Building structured systems for high-complexity, real-world environments using SQL, analytics, and AI-assisted workflow design.

This portfolio documents my transition from 15+ years in CX & Operations into Data + AI-powered Operations, with a focus on practical, applied systems thinking.

## 🧩 ChaosOS™ AI Workflow Architecture
*A real, working multi-agent GPT operating system.*

![ChaosOS Architecture](chaosOS/assets/chaosOS-architecture.png)

ChaosOS is a role-based, multi-agent framework I designed inside GPT to model, manage, and reason through complex, multi-step workflows across diverse domains.
It powers decisions for:

* medical coordination & escalation

* legal & compliance reasoning

* government case management

* financial and risk workflows

* travel safety & logistics

* education planning & learning systems

* job search targeting

* multi-step planning & cross-domain analysis


ChaosOS is both:

1. A real AI-assisted system I use to organize and reason through complex, interdependent tasks, and

2. A portfolio artifact demonstrating how I design Data + AI workflows, agent roles, guardrails, and decision flows.

## 👋 About Me

I bring **15+ years in Customer Experience & Operations** — leading remote teams, running high-volume workflows, managing escalations, and rebuilding broken processes.

**My core strengths include:**

* structured analytical reasoning

* workflow modeling & ops design

* data interpretation & problem framing

* AI-assisted decision architecture

cross-domain system thinking

I’m now expanding my skillset into SQL, BI, and data-driven operations, and documenting that progression through projects like ChaosOS, KidOS, and SQL practice workflows.

## 🧠 ChaosOS™ — System Overview
ChaosOS follows a hub-and-spoke architecture similar to modern data + ops systems.

**Core Layers**

**BRG — Bridge Layer**
Routes context safely between specialized agents.

**SCX — Shared Context Layer**
Stores stable truths, constraints, and long-term information.

**LifeVaultDB — Evidence Layer**
Maintains documents, timelines, and cross-domain reference history.

Spokes (Agents)

33+ domain-specific agents, including:

* **HEA / FHEA** — Medical coordination

* **LEG** — Legal strategy & compliance

* **PER** — Safety & behavioral reasoning

* **MON / FIN** — Money, budgeting, and risk

* **TRV** — Travel logistics

* **JOB** — Career navigation

* **COA** — Admin & ops support

* **KID / SCH** — Family & education workflows

* **DEC** — Meta-level decision engine

* **REL** — Relocation logic

Each agent owns a domain.
BRG controls context flow.
DEC consolidates logic.
SCX stabilizes long-term truth.
