## 👋 About Me

I’ve spent 15+ years in **Customer Experience and Operations**, leading remote teams, fixing broken processes, and keeping messy systems from falling apart.

Now I’m pivoting into **Data + AI-powered Ops** — using SQL, analytics, and AI systems to design workflows that are:
- measurable  
- automatable  
- resilient enough for real life  

This repo is where I document that transition.

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Data + AI-powered **operations design**
- **SQL** fundamentals and query patterns
- **Analytics workflows** for decision support
- **Multi-agent GPT systems** (ChaosOS™)
- Git & GitHub as my base for versioned work

---

## 📂 Portfolio Structure

This repository will grow over time. Planned structure:

- `chaosos/` – documentation and diagrams for **ChaosOS™**, my multi-agent GPT operating system for complex workflows and decision support.
- `sql-practice/` – sample schemas, queries, joins, and analysis patterns as I build SQL depth.
- `analytics-workflows/` – examples of turning business questions into data questions, then into queries and insights.
- `ai-ops-labs/` – experiments using AI to automate tickets, documentation, planning, and decision flows.
- `notes/` – condensed learning notes on SQL, BI, Git, and AI Ops concepts.

*(Folders will appear as I build them out.)*

## 🧠 ChaosOS™ – High-Level Overview

**ChaosOS™** is a role-based, multi-agent system I built inside GPT to manage high-complexity, multi-domain life and work:

- Separate “spokes” for **legal, finance, health, homeschool, work, planning, and reflection**
- A **bridge layer (BRG)** that routes the right context between agents without letting them blend into a chaotic mess
- A **decision spoke (DEC)** that pulls from multiple agents to support structured decisions
- A **master hub (HSM/SCX)** that tracks permanent facts and long-term context

Here on GitHub, I’ll be:
- documenting the architecture
- mapping spokes to real workflows
- showing how this thinking transfers into **Data + AI Ops** in a professional environment

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Stack

- **Languages / Query:** SQL (learning), basic Python later
- **Data & BI:** Excel/Sheets, Tableau (prior exposure), BI fundamentals in progress
- **AI:** GPT-5 multi-agent patterns, workflow reasoning, prompt+system design
- **Collaboration & Ops:** Jira, Salesforce, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, remote ops tooling
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub (active learning)

---

## 📚 Learning Path

I’m currently upskilling through:

- **DataCamp & Maven Analytics** – SQL, analytics, BI concepts
- Self-directed projects like **ChaosOS™** and AI-augmented workflows
- GitHub-based practice to keep everything versioned and visible

This repo is meant to show:
- how I **think about systems**
- how I **structure messy problems**
- how I apply **data + AI** to real-world operations challenges
