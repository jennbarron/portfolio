## 👋 About Me
15+ years in Customer Experience & Operations — managing escalations, regulated workflows, and high-volume support.  
Now transitioning into Data + AI-powered Operations with strengths in:

- Structured analytical reasoning  
- SQL + BI fundamentals  
- Workflow modeling & process design  
- Multi-agent AI system architecture  
- Cross-domain decision logic  

This repository documents my hands-on learning path, portfolio projects, and the systems I’ve built.

## 📌 Portfolio Highlights

### 🔸 ChaosOS™ — AI Workflow Architecture  
A real, working multi-agent system I designed in GPT to model and solve complex, multi-domain problems including medical escalation, legal disputes, financial investigations, logistics, and safety reasoning.

### 🔸 SQL Practice Lab (Beginner → Intermediate)  
A structured SQL progression demonstrating real-world analytics skills: joins, aggregations, subqueries, window functions, and CTEs.

### 🔸 Analytics Workflows  
Business → data conversion examples, KPI models, and operational decision trees.

### 🔸 AI Ops Labs  
Experiments in prompt engineering, agent roles, guardrail logic, and automated reasoning flows.

## 🧠 ChaosOS™ — System Overview

ChaosOS is built using a hub-and-spoke architecture similar to modern Data/AI Ops platforms.  
It centralizes reasoning and distributes work across 33+ domain agents.

### Core Layers
- **BRG (Bridge)** — safe routing of context  
- **SCX** — shared long-term memory  
- **LifeVaultDB** — evidence, documents, timelines  

### Spokes (Agents)
33+ domain-specific agents including medical (HEA/FHEA), legal (LEG), budgeting (MON/FIN), safety/behavior (PER), travel (TRV), career navigation (JOB), and more.

### Output Layer
Consolidated plans, decisions, risk assessments, structured messages, and ops workflows.
