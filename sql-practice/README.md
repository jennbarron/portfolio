**SQL Practice – Queries, Patterns & Mini Case Studies**

A growing collection of SQL exercises built as part of my Data/AI Operations study path.

**This directory contains real-world-style SQL practice that reflects the skills needed for roles in:**

* Data Analytics
* Business Intelligence
* Operations Analysis
* AI-assisted data workflows
* Reporting & insights

**Instead of isolated “toy” problems, the practice here is built around patterns:**

* filtering
* joins
* aggregations
* window functions
* subqueries
* CTEs
* data cleaning logic
* analytical thinking

Each exercise ties into how ChaosOS™ structures problem-solving:
clean data → clear logic → applied decision-making.

🚀 What This Folder Includes
✔️ Foundational SQL Queries

**Simple queries to build comfort with:**

* SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
* GROUP BY
* JOIN types
* Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.)

✔️ _**Intermediate Patterns**_

**Problems focused on:**

* multi-table joins
* subqueries
* CTE-based logic
* CASE statements
* ranking functions

✔️ _**Analytics-Focused Challenges**_

**These represent actual business problems like:**

* identifying churn patterns
* analyzing sales performance
* operational bottlenecks
* customer segment insights
* anomaly detection

More datasets + problems will be added as my study path progresses.

📚 **Why This Exists (Actual Purpose)**

**This SQL section isn't for show, it's part of my transition into:**

Data Analytics → BI → AI-powered Operations.

**The goal is to demonstrate:**

* tactical SQL competency
* analytical thinking
* structured problem-solving
* ability to turn data into decisions
* ability to build repeatable workflows

Every exercise reinforces what I’m learning through Maven, DataCamp, and hands-on projects.

🧩 _**How to Run The Queries**_

**All exercises are written to run in:**

* DataCamp Workspace
* SQL Fiddle
* SQLite online editors
* Local SQL tools _(optional)_

You do not need to download anything. Each .sql file includes a note on what tool it’s compatible with.

📈 **Future Additions**

**Coming soon:**

* more datasets (sales, CX, logistics, healthcare ops)
* dashboard starter files (Tableau/Power BI)
* case-study style SQL challenges
* advanced window-function practice
* ChaosOS™-style analytical templates

🧠 **About This Folder**

This SQL directory is part of my larger study ecosystem, but is also designed to be a standalone portfolio component I can share with recruiters and hiring managers.
