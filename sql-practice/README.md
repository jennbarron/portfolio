# SQL Practice Lab (Beginner → Intermediate)

A structured SQL progression demonstrating real-world analytics and operations logic.

---

## 📘 What This Folder Contains
Each SQL file represents a learning milestone:

- **01-basic-queries.sql** → SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY  
- **02-joins.sql** → INNER / LEFT / RIGHT JOIN  
- **03-aggregations.sql** → SUM, COUNT, GROUP BY  
- **04-subqueries.sql** → subqueries + correlated subqueries  
- **05-ctes.sql** → Common Table Expressions  
- **06-window-functions.sql** → ROW_NUMBER, RANK, PARTITION

## 🤖 Real-World Context  
All examples use ChaosOS-style schemas:

`chaos_events`, `chaos_domains`, `chaos_agents`, etc.  

So the queries feel like practical ops/analytics work — not fake textbook scenarios.

## 🎯 Goal  
Show clear SQL progression from fundamentals → intermediate analytics → BI-ready querying.

This proves:
- ability to write SQL  
- structure queries  
- think in tables  
- model real business questions
