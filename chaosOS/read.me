# ChaosOS™ — Multi-Agent AI Workflow System

ChaosOS is a operational AI framework built entirely in GPT using structured prompt design, domain agents, guardrails, and cross-context routing.

Its purpose:  
To handle *complex, multi-domain real-world problems* with structure, stability, and auditability.

## 🔧 System Architecture

### Core Components
- **BRG (Bridge Layer)** → Safely routes context between agents
- **SCX (Shared Context)** → Long-term truths, constraints, stable memory
- **LifeVaultDB** → Evidence + history storage (timelines, logs, docs)

### Spokes (Agents)
33+ domain agents including:
LEG, HEA/FHEA, PER, MON/FIN, TRV, JOB, COA, REL, SCH/KID, DEC.

Each agent has:
- A narrow domain  
- Clear boundaries  
- No shared memory  
- Guardrails enforced by BRG

## 📚 Case Studies
See `/chaosOS/examples/` for anonymized, real-world scenarios including:
- Diagnostic escalation  
- Repo correction  
- System error detection  
- Financial forensics  
- Personal safety reasoning  
- Job targeting  

Each demonstrates multi-agent reasoning, timeline reconstruction, and structured decision design.
